# Music Library Web Application

*Music Library* is a web application designed to help users organize and manage their personal music collection. The application features a fully functional backend and frontend that seamlessly communicate, providing a smooth and efficient user experience. With CRUD functionality, users can:
* **Create** new artists and albums to build and expand their collection.
* **Read** details about each artist and album through an intuitive interface.
* **Update** existing records to keep their collection accurate and up-to-date.
* **Delete** artists or albums they no longer wish to keep.

I originally created this app in early 2022 to help me feel more prepared for my first real software job as a backend engineer. Recently, I revisited it to make some improvements, using GitHub Copilot to refine and enhance the appâ€™s functionality and overall code quality.

Feel free to watch a demo of the application [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17tysPXvlvcPFj3Ry_MMTgoGsHSXxm1EB/view?usp=drive_link)!
